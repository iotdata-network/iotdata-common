// test_module_buffers_locked.c - d_module_buffers.h built WITH locking, and actually run threaded.
//
// The unlocked tests next door prove the accounting. This one proves the guard: that the free map,
// the reference counts and the counters survive concurrent acquire/unref. It is a separate TU
// because the locking is a compile-time choice -- the caller defines the four macros or gets
// nothing -- so the two builds cannot coexist in one file.
//
// The exclusivity check is the point. A race in the free map does not corrupt a counter, it hands
// ONE buffer to TWO threads, and on a relay that surfaces as a garbled frame on air that looks
// exactly like a radio problem. So each thread stamps its whole buffer with its own id, waits, and
// reads it back: if another thread were handed the same buffer, the stamp would not survive.
