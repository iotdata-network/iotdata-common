# Makefile — iotdata-common.
#
# This repo builds nothing of its own: it is headers, app bodies and host test
# suites that other repos compile. So the only target that does real work is
# `format`, which runs clang-format over everything in here that clang-format
# owns. More targets can land beside it later (the test suites in tests/ are the
# obvious next one) without changing the shape of this file.
#
# Paths resolve from THIS file's own location, the same idiom make/config.mk uses
# on itself, so `make -f .../iotdata-common/Makefile format` works from any
# directory, and so an overridden IOTDATA_SRC can never aim `format` at a
# different tree than the one this Makefile sits in.
#
# NB: keep comments on their own lines — a trailing "# ..." after a value would
# leave the spaces before the # in the variable.
